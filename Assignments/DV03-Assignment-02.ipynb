    "## Tableau Desktop\n",
    "Tableau has grown in a few years time to one of the most popular data visuazalization tools in the business intelligence (BI) and data science world. While its GUI interface and output make it difficult to fit into a reproducible workflow, it can be extremely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It connects easily to all kinds of data sources, including database servers (plugin sometimes needed) and Spark.\n",
    "* It allows you to create elaborate explorative plots that follow many design principles.\n",
    "* You can deploy presentation quality interactive visualizations with storytelling elements connected with streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Tableau\n",
    "While the interface of Tableau is certainly intuitive, it appears very daunting at first. There are many resources to help you learn working with Tableau:\n",

    "* http://www.tableau.com/learn/training (check out the on-demand videos)\n",
    "* http://www.tableau.com/support/manuals/quickstart (quickstart guides)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we prefer a more hands-on approach in which you will create several visualizations from a tutorial.\n",
